## Interazione uomo-macchina (2018): case study on visualizations for usability studies

The contribution of this project consists of two macro activities:
- The first, common to all groups, involves the extension of UTAssistant in two points: definition of the ideal navigation path: during the definition of the tasks, the evaluator must be able to define the ideal path. This must be done by clicking, from the task definition screen, on a button that determines the opening of a pop-up (e.g. modal in bootstrap) with the site to be evaluated inside, opened to the home page of the task; the evaluator will navigate the site following the ideal path to complete the task in progress. When finished, he will close the pop-up and the navigation path addresses will be saved in a special DB table (details of the table in the shared document). Recording of the users' navigation paths: for each task performed by a user, the addresses of his navigation path must be saved in a special DB table (details of the table in the shared document).
- The second phase, instead, consists in displaying the data of the navigation paths of each task through the use of a Sankey Diagram.
